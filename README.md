# 👋 Hi, I'm Aryan Tomar

I am a Software Developer and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about creating intelligent, full-stack systems.
From crafting robust APIs and responsive web apps to designing machine learning pipelines, I love engineering products that merge functionality with intelligence.
My goal is to build end-to-end solutions that make data useful, scalable, and impactful.
